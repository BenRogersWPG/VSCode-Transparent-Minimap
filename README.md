# Transparent Minimap

This extension makes your VS Code minimap transparent. You can adjust the level of transparency using the extension settings and even make your minimap a different color if you wish.

## Features ✨

- Turns your minimap transparent out of the box
- Gives you more horizontal space when coding, as the code displays behind the minimap (*excellent for vertical monitors or smaller screens*)
- Adjust minimap transparency or minimap color
- Easy to use and configure
- Runs on Visual Studio Code for the Web (vscode.dev)
- Walkthrough to help you get started using the extension
- **NEW** Apply color changes immediately without needing to restart VS Code
- Lots of extension settings for your own customizations

## How To Use 👇

*This extension comes packaged with a walkthrough. Use it to learn how to use the extension. (run `Get Started: Open Walkthrough` from the Command Palette)*

## Extension Settings ⚙️

### `TransparentMinimap.transparencyLevel`

Transparency level / opacity of the minimap.
`00` is full transparent, `88` would be half-transparent and colored, `FF` would be no transparency and full color.
Remember to run the `Refresh Minimap Transparency Settings` command to apply the changes

### `TransparentMinimap.minimapColor`

Color of the minimap.
For example, `000000` is no color, `FF0000` would be fully red, `111111` would be faint grey
